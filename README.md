# Image Resizer and Compressor

This Python script is designed to resize and compress images in a specified folder. The resizing process maintains the aspect ratio of the images, ensuring that they fit within specified width and height constraints. The compression is applied to reduce file sizes while maintaining acceptable image quality. The script utilizes the Pillow (PIL) library for image processing and the tqdm library for a progress bar.
